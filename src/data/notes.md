# MENTAL
- **Appraise** – Rely on experience and comparison to reach an evaluation. Determine economic value, judge strengths and weaknesses, rank things, find the best angle.
- **Deduce** – Rely on logic and theory to make inferences. Systematically test a hypothesis, translate codes and languages, compile overwhelming information or calculate probabilities.
- **Locate** – Rely on an eye for detail and knowledge about your target to sort out the noise. Find what is hidden, track who passed here before, see what sticks out or get your bearings.
- **Sense** – Rely on intuition and empathy to read people. Sense motives and judge reactions, anticipate betrayal or open your mind to new experiences.

# PHYSICAL
- **Wreck** – Rely on force and explosiveness to cause havoc. Kick down a door, fuck shit up, overwhelm an opponent, spring an ambush or destroy a bar room.
- **Finesse** – Rely on dexterity to achieve precision, accuracy, fidelity, exactness. Take the perfect shot, make an accurate incision, pick the inside pocket or manipulate the gears of the safe, make a realistic drawing.
- **Control** – Rely on balance and calibration to stay on top, slow things down, stabilize, hold something back. Pin down your opponent, ride a mount through difficult terrain, steer a vehicle at high speed.
- **Prowl** – Rely on agility and stealth to move smoothly, discreetly, with subtlety. Pass undetected, slit a throat without a sound, evaporate into the night.

# SOCIAL
- **Captivate** – Rely on poise and drama to attract attention. Entertain an audience, make the guards think you are the larger threat, charm someone, cause disgust.
- **Command** – Rely on presence or dominance to cause obedience or subordination. Instil fear, manipulate loyalties or inspire confidence. Direct troops in battle, give precise and detailed orders.
- **Feign** – Rely on acting and bluffing to cause confusion and misunderstanding. Pretend to be someone or something you’re not, feint to open an opponent to attack, put on a poker face.
- **Convince** – Rely on argument and reason to influence someone to change their opinion, preferences or beliefs. Explain something really well, give a detailed account of an event, adapt your message to your audience.


# New XP rules
## Ways to get XP:
- Roll a desperate Action roll: Check one box in the relevant XP trigger track (Mental, Physical, Social). When full, add one dot to an Action of that type.
- XP triggers:
    - Address a challenge with a grand gesture (max 2/session)
    - Express your beliefs, heritage or background (max 2/session)
    - Struggle with issues from your vice or trauma (max 2/session)
- Train: Use 2 downtime actions to train. Take one XP in the relevant track. You can train a given XP track only once per downtime.

You review your XP triggers at the end of each session and simply tell the rest of the group how much XP you got. You may mark end-of-session XP on any XP track you want (Mental, Physical, Social, Special Ability).

OBS. Your Express/Struggle XP track is renamed Special Ability.

## Grand gestures
You have access to grand gestures, the same number and types as your dots in virtues. Use a grand gesture, motivated in the fiction, to gain +1 XP. A grand gesture has a specific type. Grand gestures are restored when all grand gestures have been used. The grand gestures are as follows:
- **Humility**: Avoid taking credit for something you did and miss a reward.
- **Honesty**: Speak the truth when lying would be safer.
- **Justice**: Accept a warranted punishment without resisting.
- **Dignity**: Refuse to pretend to be something you are not and face danger instead.
- **Bravery**: Accept a negative consequence to protect someone you don’t know.
- **Curiosity**: Unveil a secret and gain an enemy.
- **Ambition**: Take credit for what you achieve and attract trouble.
- **Creativity**: Leave an artistic mark when discretion would be safer.
- **Mercy**: Forgive someone a debt or spare someone from harm they deserve.
- **Tolerance**: Support someone else’s choice even when it harms you somehow.
- **Caution**: Surrender rather than take a risky fight
- **Loyalty**: Stand up for someone close when they don't deserve it.
